First day of project. Dowloaded the ROM and tested it on SameBoy Emulator, it
works fine.

- 1st Goal: Make Mario run by himself, without the user pressing the -> button.

- When the game is running, we are at the address [0x000297]

- The general gameboy memory map:
  + [0000] - [3FFF]: 16KB ROM bank 00. Usually  a fixed bank.
  + [4000] - [7FFF]: 16KB ROM Bank 01~NN. Switchable via Memory Bank Controllers.
  + [8000] - [9FFF]: 8KB VRAM.
  + [A000] - [BFFF]: 8KB External RAM.
  + [C000] - [CFFF]: 4KB WRAM. Bank 0.
  + [D000] - [DFFF]: 4KB WRAM. Bank 1~N.
  + [E000] - [FDFF]: Mirror of ECHORAM. Nintendo forbids the use of this area lol.
  + [FE00] - [FE9F]: Sprite attribute table (Object Attribute Memory).
  + [FEA0] - [FEFF]: Nintendo also forbids the use of this area and this one is
                     unused indeed.
  + [FF00] - [FF7F]: I/O Registers.*
  + [FF80] - [FFFE]: HRAM.
  + [FFFF] - [FFFF]: Interrupts Enable Register.

* That's the address range we want to explore on this first goal.
